Unlike standard saturators that offer just one flavour, PHATurator lets you stack and blend six distinct analogue circuits—from Tube and Tape to FET and Class A Preamp styles—to colour your sound with rich harmonics, depth, and controlled grit. It also features a global Mix knob for instant parallel processing." },

Very loudness-friendly.</li><li class='mb-1'><strong class='text-white'>WARMTH:</strong> Thick, transformer-rich 70s British Class A preamp vibe with creamy low mids.</li></ul>" },

          { "q": "What DAWs does it work on?", "a": "It works in any DAW that supports VST3, AU, or AAX plugins. This includes Logic Pro X, Pro Tools, Ableton Live, Cubase, Studio One, FL Studio, Reaper, and Bitwig." },
