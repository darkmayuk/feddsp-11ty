    "about": "We are proudly independent, passionate about making music, and we imagine and create the audio tools that we want to use in our own musical work.\nFed Telesca is the instigator and heart of fedDSP. It is from Fed's 15 year experience as an industry leading producer and mastering engineer that he knows what musical tools should exist, but don't. Fed has the imagination to dream up new tools, and the exacting standards to build them into finished products that exceed the quality of anything else that is already out there.\nFed is joined by a six man dream team, built around decades of experience in the music business: from performing, mixing, engineering, videography, promotion, and touring. Every one of the team is an active, passionate, and highly regarded musician in their own right.",
